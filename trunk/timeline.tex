\section{Project timeline and management plan}

Our budget requests \$150,000 per year mainly to fund the effort of
the PIs and co-PIs in the form of summer support -- 1 month for the PI
and 0.4 month for each of the co-PIs -- and additional funding for
supporting two graduate students (one student at CMU and one student
at Northeastern).
