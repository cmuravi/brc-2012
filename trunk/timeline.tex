\section{Project timeline and management plan}

This timeline for this project is given in the table below.  The
effort is roughly evenly distributed over the 5 year span of the
project.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||}
\hline\hline
{\bf Topic} & {\bf Years} & {\bf PIs (lead in bold)}\\\hline\hline
Survivable network design & 1-5 & {\bf Ravi}, Rajaraman\\\hline
Stochastic aggregation tree problems & 2-4 & {\bf Ravi}, Sundaram\\\hline
Universal aggregation trees  & 1-4 & {\bf Sundaram}, Rajaraman\\ \hline
Congestion-minimizing degree-bounded flows & 3-5 & {\bf Sundaram}, Ravi\\ \hline
Information dissemination in adversarial networks & 1-3 & {\bf Rajaraman}, Ravi\\ \hline

Our budget requests \$150,000 per year mainly to fund the effort of
the PIs and co-PIs in the form of summer support -- 1 month for the PI
and 0.4 month for each of the co-PIs -- and additional funding for
supporting two graduate students (one student at CMU and one student
at Northeastern).
