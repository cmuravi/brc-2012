\section{Technical Approaches and Recent Related Work}
The optimization problems raised in this proposal pose two major
challenges.  First, how do we deal with uncertainty, whether it is in
the node pairs being connected in the survivable network design
problem, the location of targets in the aggregation tree problem, or
the dynamic network topology in the information flow problems?
Second, how do we ensure that our algorithms can be implemented with
little coordination among the network nodes?

We plan to attack the issue of uncertainty by developing algorithms
for a spectrum of models spanning from {\em stochastic}, where the
unknown online inputs are assumed to be drawn from some known
probability distribution, to {\em adversarial}, where the inputs or
network dynamics are completely under adversarial control.  For the
design of fully-distributed algorithms, we propose to study new {\em
  distributed methods}\/ for constructing network decompositions that
are at the heart of many effective network design algorithms.  We will
also focus on gossip-style algorithms for information flow, which are
inherently decentralized, and have the promise of achieving
near-optimality in highly dynamic environments.  We now elaborate on
the specific technical approaches for the problems listed in
Section~\ref{sec:goals}.
